The Oxford Companion to Philosophy says , " there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold , and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance . "
In the end , for anarchist historian <START:PER> Daniel Guerin <END> " Some anarchists are more individualistic than social , some more social than individualistic .
From this climate <START:PER> William Godwin <END> developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought .
<START:PER> Godwin <END> was , according to <START:PER> Peter Kropotkin <END> , " the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism , even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work " , while <START:PER> Godwin <END> attached his anarchist ideas to an early <START:PER> Edmund Burke <END> .
Its classical period , which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939 , is associated with the working-class movements of the nineteenth century and the Spanish Civil War-era struggles against fascism .
Due to its links to active workers ' movements , the International became a significant organization .
<START:PER> Karl Marx <END> became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council .
<START:PER> Proudhon <END> 's followers , the mutualists , opposed <START:PER> Marx <END> 's state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings .
They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International , who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property .
Subsequently , the International became polarised into two camps , with <START:PER> Marx <END> and <START:PER> Bakunin <END> as their respective figureheads .
In response , unions across America prepared a general strike in support of the event .
The incident became known as the <START:PER> Haymarket affair <END> , and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day .
The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the <START:PER> Haymarket affair <END> .
<START:PER> Malatesta <END> warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself , whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it .
The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo ( National Confederation of Labour : CNT ) , founded in 1910 .
CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003 .
Other active syndicalist movements include the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation .
Some anarchists , such as <START:PER> Johann Most <END> , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because " we preach not only action in and for itself , but also action as propaganda . "
The anarcho-syndicalist , <START:PER> Fernand Pelloutier <END> , argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without " the individual dynamiter . "
For example , U.S. President <START:PER> McKinley <END> 's assassin <START:PER> Leon Czolgosz <END> claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist <START:PER> Emma Goldman <END> .
This was in spite of <START:PER> Goldman <END> 's disavowal of any association with him , his registered membership in the Republican Party , and never having belonged to an anarchist organization .
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I ( 1914 -- 18 ) and the 1917 October Revolution .
Important factors towards this include state repression , the level of organization of the labour movement , and the influence of the October Revolution [ citation needed ] .
Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions , and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup .
However , the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition , a conflict that culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed .
Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia , criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised .
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally .
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo , which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions , and achieved some success in their activism , such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922 .
But in 1936 , the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power .
Months later , the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War ( 1936 -- 1939 ) .
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists .
In the U.K. this was associated with the punk rock movement , as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols .
Anarchist anthropologist <START:PER> David Graeber <END> and anarchist historian <START:PER> Andrej Grubacic <END> have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism , with those " who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits " of the nineteenth century contrasted with the younger activists who are " much more informed , among other elements , by indigenous , feminist , ecological and cultural-critical ideas " , and who by the turn of the 21st century formed " by far the majority " of anarchists .
Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , Group of Eight , and the World Economic Forum .
A landmark struggle of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999 .
One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was " anarchism without adjectives " , a call for toleration first adopted by <START:PER> Fernando Tarrida del Mármol <END> in 1889 in response to the " bitter debates " of anarchist theory at the time .
<START:PER> Proudhon <END> proposed spontaneous order , whereby organization emerges without central authority , a " positive anarchy " where order arises when everybody does " what he wishes and only what he wishes " and where " business transactions alone produce the social order . "
According to <START:PER> William Batchelder Greene <END> , each worker in the mutualist system would receive " just and exact pay for his work ; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost , without profit or discount . "
<START:PER> Proudhon <END> first characterised his goal as a " third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property . "
<START:PER> Godwin <END> , a philosophical anarchist , from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present " necessary evil " that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge .
<START:PER> Godwin <END> advocated extreme individualism , proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good .
<START:PER> Godwin <END> was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value , with some of us " of more worth and importance " than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good .
<START:PER> Godwin <END> opposed government because he saw it as infringing on the individual 's right to " private judgement " to determine which actions most maximise utility , but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual 's judgement .
This aspect of <START:PER> Godwin <END> 's philosophy , stripped of utilitarian motivations , was developed into a more extreme form later by <START:PER> Stirner <END> .
The most extreme form of individualist anarchism , called " egoism, " or egoist anarchism , was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism , <START:PER> Max Stirner <END> .
<START:PER> Stirner <END> 's The Ego and Its Own , published in 1844 , is a founding text of the philosophy .
To <START:PER> Stirner <END> , rights were spooks in the mind , and he held that society does not exist but " the individuals are its reality " .
<START:PER> Stirner <END> 's philosophy has been seen as a precedent of existentialism with other thinkers like <START:PER> Friedrich Nietzsche <END> and <START:PER> Søren Kierkegaard <END> .
Collectivist anarchism , also referred to as " revolutionary socialism " or a form of such , is a revolutionary form of anarchism , commonly associated with <START:PER> Mikhail Bakunin <END> and <START:PER> Johann Most <END> .
It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as <START:PER> Lucy Parsons <END> , <START:PER> Emma Goldman <END> , <START:PER> Voltairine de Cleyre <END> , and <START:PER> Dora Marsden <END> .
It developed " mostly in Holland , Britain , and the U.S. , before and during the Second World War " .
Another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is insurrectionary anarchism , which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state ; its proponents include <START:PER> Wolfi Landstreicher <END> and <START:PER> Alfredo M. Bonanno <END> .
Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to <START:PER> Josiah Warren <END> and to experimental communities , viewed sexual freedom as a clear , direct expression of an individual 's self-ownership .
In New York 's Greenwich Village , bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women ( and also men ) in the here and now .
They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality , and the openly bisexual radical <START:PER> Edna St. Vincent Millay <END> and the lesbian anarchist <START:PER> Margaret Anderson <END> were prominent among them .
Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman , indeed the first and only American , to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public . "
<START:PER> Max Stirner <END> wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called The False Principle of our Education .
In it <START:PER> Stirner <END> names his educational principle " personalist, " explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation .
Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was <START:PER> Francisco Ferrer <END> 's Modern School ( Escuela Moderna ) , a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally . "
The first of these was started in New York City in 1911 .
Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice .
The term deschooling was popularized by <START:PER> Ivan Illich <END> , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead .
According to <START:PER> Luther <END> 's notetaker <START:PER> Mathesius <END> , <START:PER> Luther <END> thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that he be suffocated .
Almost all the characteristics described in <START:PER> Kanner <END> 's first paper on the subject , notably " autistic aloneness " and " insistence on sameness " , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders .
<START:PER> Kanner <END> 's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatry 's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant 's response to " refrigerator mothers " .
The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely .
Another notable high albedo body is Eris , with an albedo of 0.86 .
Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect of albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests .
Over Antarctica they average a little more than 0.8 .

Alabama ( i i i / l ə ˈ b æ m ə / ) is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States of America .
It is bordered by Tenn. to the north , Georgia to the east , Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south , and Mississippi to the west .
Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways .
Following World War II , Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing , mineral extraction , education , and technology .
In addition , the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations , primarily those of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force , added to state jobs .
The capital of Ala. is Montgomery .
The largest city by population is Birmingham .
The largest city by total land area is Huntsville .
Although the origin of Ala. could be discerned , sources disagree on its meaning .
This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of <START:PER> Alexander Beaufort Meek <END> .
Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba ( meaning " plants " or " weeds " ) and amo ( meaning " to cut " , " to trim " , or " to gather " ) .
Ala. was part of the new frontier in the 1820s and 1830s .
The economy of the central " Black Belt " was built around large cotton plantations whose owners built their wealth on slave labor .
While few battles were fought in the state , Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the American Civil War .
After the Civil War , the state was still chiefly agricultural , with an economy tied to cotton .
In 1900 , fourteen Black Belt counties had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls .
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 also protected the suffrage of poor whites .
The population growth rate in Ala. dropped by nearly half from 1910 -- 1920 , reflecting the effect of emigration .
At the same time , many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of Birmingham for work in new industrial jobs .
It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed " The Magic City " .
By the 1920s , Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30 % of the population of the state .
In addition , the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham .
One result was that Jefferson County , containing Birmingham 's industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not received a proportional amount in services .
A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination , " A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature . "
These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs .
Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought prosperity .
In the 1960s under Governor <START:PER> George Wallace <END> , many whites in the state opposed integration efforts .
After 1972 , the state 's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections ( as also occurred in neighboring southern states ) .
Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have voted increasingly Republican in state elections .
Democrats are still the majority party in both houses of the legislature .
